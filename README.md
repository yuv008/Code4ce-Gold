## üìñ Overview

**Warcast** is an AI-powered news aggregator platform designed to provide personalized and real-time strategic news from various sources. By leveraging advanced machine learning models and NLP techniques, Warcast curates news feeds that adapt to user preferences, delivering updates on the most relevant global and geopolitical content.

## Key Features:

- **Personalized News Feed**: Uses a hybrid collaborative filtering model to recommend news articles based on user interactions (likes, bookmarks, etc.).
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Utilizes fine-tuned `BERT` and `DistilBERT` models along with `nltk` for comprehensive sentiment analysis, classifying news as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
- **Text Summarization**: Implements Facebook's `BART` model for generating concise summaries (150 words) of lengthy news articles.
- **Multilingual Support**: The platform supports multiple languages, ensuring accessibility to a diverse audience.
- **Real-time News**: Aggregates news from 10+ sources, updated regularly to ensure fresh content.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Data Aggregation**:  
   Warcast scrapes news articles from 10+ sources using `Selenium` and `BeautifulSoup4`, storing relevant data such as headlines, summaries, and article metadata in MongoDB.

2. **Sentiment Analysis**:  
   Each article is analyzed for sentiment using fine-tuned `BERT` and `DistilBERT` models, with `nltk` helping categorize the sentiment into Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

3. **Summarization**:  
   Long articles are summarized into concise 150-word versions using Facebook‚Äôs `BART` (large CNN model), allowing users to quickly grasp key points.

4. **Personalization**:  
   User activities (likes, bookmarks) are tracked, and a hybrid machine learning model recommends tailored news content for each user.

5. **Multilingual Support**:  
   Users can view news in their preferred languages, enhancing the global reach of Warcast.
